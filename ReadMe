## HTML Validation

HTML templates were validated using [W3C Nu HTML Checker](https://validator.w3.org/nu/). For Django templates, validation was performed on the **rendered output** to avoid false positives caused by `{% %}` and `{{ }}` syntax.

### HTML Validation Screenshots and Results

| **Template**            | **Status** | **Screenshot**                                                  | **Notes**                                                                                         |

## JavaScript Validation

JavaScript was tested both via the browser console (DevTools) and [JSHint](https://jshint.com), with `/* jshint esversion: 6 */` enabled to support modern ES6 syntax.

| **Script**             | **Tested Features**                                | **Warnings / Errors**                      | **Notes**                                                                 |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `cart.js`              | Cart update/remove, subtotal sync                  | 11 ES6 syntax warnings                     | Uses `const`, `let`, and arrow functions — standard in modern JS. Console remains clean. |
| `stripe_elements.js`   | Stripe field creation, validation, modal close     | 18 ES6 syntax warnings<br>1 undefined var: `Stripe` | Warnings are expected. `Stripe` is loaded via external CDN and is present at runtime. |
| *(inline)* `modal.js`  | Promo popup display, welcome modal popup           | None                                       | Uses `localStorage` to show the welcome popup only once. Works flawlessly. |

> All JavaScript executes without runtime errors. Console logs show no issues across any pages. ES6 features are used intentionally.


Lighthouse reports were also checked for runtime issues and passed cleanly.

## Python Validation

Python code was linted using `flake8`.

| **File/Module**     | **Errors** | **Warnings** | **Notes**                                      |
|---------------------|------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------|
| All apps (`*.py`)   | 0          | Some line length | Code follows PEP8 with minor styling (ignored) |
| `settings.py`       | 0          | 0            | Environment management done via `decouple`     |
| `views.py`          | 0          | 0            | Views validated, CRUD logic clean              |

> All Python files passed linting and function as expected.
